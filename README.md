# GTerminal
The world's first terminal installer for mods on Gorilla Tag. ðŸ˜Ž

(Disclaimer) Use only for development/educational purposes. I am not responsible for anything happening.
Most mods are checked for viruses, but it is not guaranteed. I highly think you should run your mod through DNSpy, and if anything suspicious is found, join the <a href="https://discord.gg/Fa36fvAdXE">Discord Server</a> and make a report.

*but there are so many other ways to install mods!!! why should I use GTerminal???*
- [x] Open Source
