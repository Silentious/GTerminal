## Installation
### 1. Unzip the file
This doesn't require explaining.

### 2. Install Dependencies.
```console
# change directory to where you installed the files
$ cd Downloads
$ cd GTerminal
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
# some might get an error but Idk because i'm not gonna find out by deleting them.
```
### 3. Run in terminal
Command prompt works fine, but you can also use Windows Powershell.
